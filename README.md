Machine vision algorithms

Main algorithm in machine vision : segmentation using Bayes rules and tracking using a particule filter

Implementation of a segmentation algorithm which training a mixture of gaussian to detect apples
Some ameliorations are made using a gabor filter and images in hvs color domain
